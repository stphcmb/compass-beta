nov28 session:
when I type in a search such as ai will replace all jobs, an author can appear multiple times under many
  domains. that's fine, but the quote needs to be different, as well as the why it matter fields.

2 more requests. 1, you already have the why it matters field. make it consistently shown for all the author
  cards when the author cards appear in a result page. 2, i like an icon to show the authors name. this way
  it's more outstanding and helps navigate easier. for example, show SA for Sam Altman. you already have this
  UI component in an earlier version of this app.
