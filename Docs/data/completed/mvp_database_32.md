### 18. ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON (Stanford)

**Core Identity:**
- **Author Type:** Academic/Researcher
- **Credibility Tier:** Seminal Thinker
- **Primary Affiliation:** Stanford University (Director of Digital Economy Lab, Senior Fellow at Stanford HAI)

**Recent Sources:**
1. "Generative AI at Work" | Quarterly Journal of Economics | May 2025 (Vol 140, Issue 2) | Academic Paper (with Li, Raymond)
2. "Erik Brynjolfsson on how AI is rewriting the rules of economy" | HBS Podcast | March 26, 2025 | Podcast Interview
3. "The Rise of Industrial AI in America: Microfoundations of the Productivity J-curve(s)" | Nov 2024 | Working Paper

**Position Summary:** Provides rigorous economic analysis of AI's productivity impacts, introducing "productivity J-curve" theory explaining lag between AI investment and measurable economic gains. Research demonstrates AI significantly boosts productivity for less-experienced workers (14-35% gains) while having minimal impact on top performers, suggesting skill-leveling effect. Advocates task-based analysis of AI's impact rather than job-level analysis, emphasizing AI will lead to work reorganization rather than mass unemployment.

**Representative Quotes:**
1. "Initially, GPTs can lead to lower measured productivity growth...It later rebounds when intangible investments start paying off...the productivity looks like a 'J'"
2. "Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both speed and quality of output, while most experienced workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality"
3. "A partnership between humans and machines works better than complete automation"

**Key Arguments:** AI adoption follows productivity J-curve (initial dip, then significant gains); task-based analysis reveals AI augments some tasks while leaving others unaffected; AI functions as knowledge transfer mechanism; less-skilled workers benefit most; traditional GDP measurements fail to capture trillions in value; "Transformative AI" within decade will fundamentally reshape economic structures

**Camp Categorizations:**
- **Future of Work:** Human-AI Collaboration + Skill Leveling (PRIMARY)
- **Enterprise:** Co-Evolution + Strategic Reorganization (PRIMARY)
- **AI Progress:** Measured Optimism with Near-term Transformation (SECONDARY)
- **Governance:** Evidence-Based + Adaptive (SECONDARY)
- **Society & Ethics:** Rigorous Realist (SECONDARY)

2. "AI pioneer warns policymakers not to let sci-fi sensationalism shape AI rules" | TechCrunch | Feb 10, 2025 | Article (Paris speech)
3. "Group co-led by Fei-Fei Li suggests AI safety laws should anticipate future risks" | TechCrunch | March 19, 2025 | Policy Report (California Joint Policy Working Group)

**Position Summary:** Advocates for human-centered AI development grounded in scientific evidence rather than speculative scenarios. As "the Godmother of AI," balances support for innovation with calls for responsible governance, emphasizing policymakers must understand AI's current capabilities and limitations to avoid both over-regulation and under-preparation. Champions vibrant, diverse AI ecosystem where academia, open-source communities, and public sector play critical roles alongside big tech companies.

**Representative Quotes:**
1. "For starters, it's essential that we govern on the basis of science, not science fiction...so much of today's AI conversations are covered by sensationalism"
2. "It's critical for policymakers to understand that chatbots and co-pilot programs are not forms of intelligence with intentions, free will or consciousness"
3. "We need to invest in far healthier and more vibrant AI ecosystems where academia and community can produce...alongside big companies"

**Key Arguments:** AI policy must be based on three principles: (1) science not science fiction, (2) pragmatism not ideology, (3) openness not restriction; policy should anticipate future risks without needing to observe harm first; open access to AI models and computational tools crucial; concentration of resources in big tech labs threatens curiosity-driven research; spatial intelligence (3D reasoning) represents next frontier
