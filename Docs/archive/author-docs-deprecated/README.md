# Deprecated Author Documentation

> **Archived:** 2026-01-07
> **Reason:** Consolidated into single authoritative guide

## What Replaced These

All these documents have been consolidated into:
- **`/Docs/reference/AUTHOR_DATABASE_GUIDE.md`** - Single source of truth for adding new authors

## Why They Were Deprecated

| Document | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| `AUTHOR_ADDITION_TEMPLATE.md` | Used wrong fields (`bio`, `x_handle`, `linkedin_url`) that don't exist in schema |
| `AUTHOR_ADDITION_GUIDE.md` | Overlapped 90% with AUTHOR_DATA_ADMINISTRATION.md |
| `AUTHOR_DATA_ADMINISTRATION.md` | Good content but redundant with other guides |
| `AUTHOR_ENRICHMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Good content but overlapped significantly |
| `QUOTES_REQUIRED_QUICKSTART.md` | Useful but integrated into main guide |

## Documents That Remain Active

- `/Docs/reference/AUTHOR_DATABASE_GUIDE.md` - **NEW: Single authoritative guide**
- `/Docs/reference/AUTHOR_ADDITION_LOG.md` - Tracking log (unchanged)
- `/Docs/reference/UPDATING_EXISTING_AUTHORS.md` - Update operations (unchanged)

## Do Not Use These Files

These archived files may contain outdated schema information. Always use the current `AUTHOR_DATABASE_GUIDE.md`.
