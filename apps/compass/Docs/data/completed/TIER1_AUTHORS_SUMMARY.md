## Key Insights

### Most Connected Camp
**Safety First** (8 authors) - Shows broad consensus on AI safety importance across diverse perspectives

### Most Contested Camp
**Democratize Fast** - Has 2 partial supporters, 2 challengers - no strong advocates in this Tier 1 cohort

### Governance Split
- **Regulatory Interventionist:** 5 strong advocates (clear majority)
- **Adaptive Governance:** 1 strong, 1 partial, 1 challenger (contested)
- **Innovation First:** 1 strong advocate (minority position)

### Technical Split
- **Scaling:** 4 strong + 1 partial (majority view)

## SQL Execution Notes

**Pre-Execution Requirements:**
1. Ensure authors table exists with schema matching INSERT
2. Ensure camp_authors table exists with foreign keys to authors and camps
3. Verify camp UUIDs match existing camp IDs in database

**Execution Order:**
Each author block:
1. INSERT INTO authors with RETURNING id
2. Multiple INSERT INTO camp_authors using SELECT from authors WHERE name = '{author}'

**Transaction Recommendation:**
Wrap entire file in transaction for atomic execution:
```sql
BEGIN;
-- Execute all INSERTs
COMMIT;
```

**Rollback Safety:**
If any INSERT fails, entire transaction can be rolled back without partial data
