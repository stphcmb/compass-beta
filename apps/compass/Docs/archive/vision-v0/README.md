## Why These Were Archived

These documents represent earlier iterations of the Compass product vision. They have been superseded by the consolidated architecture document:

**Current source of truth:** `/Docs/architecture/COMPASS_V1_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Archived Files

| File | Original Purpose | Why Archived |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| `COMPASS_V1_VISION.md` | AI Editor + Canon positioning vision | Focused only on AI discourse validation; didn't cover full content creation flow |
| `content_helper_mode.md` | Editorial integrity checking (manifesto vs. actual) | Feature absorbed into AI Editor's Intelligence Panel; separate page deprecated |
| `content_helper_integration.md` | Technical integration plan for Content Helper | Module no longer exists as separate entity |
| `compass-modular-architecture.md` | Voice Lab + modular app design | Good concepts but superseded by consolidated architecture; Voice Lab user flows were useful input |
| `voice-lab-module-concept.md` | Early Voice Lab naming and concept | Voice Lab now implemented; concept doc no longer needed |
| `COLD_START_SOLUTION.md` | Onboarding/first-use problem analysis | Less relevant for internal tool with direct user training |
