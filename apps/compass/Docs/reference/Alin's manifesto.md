#Society
The rise of LLMs signals a new age for how societies, economies, businesses, and workers operate.
AI breaks down barriers to knowledge and diminishes the power of knowledge gatekeepers–what Alin calls the “Breaking the Fourth Wall”.
AI unlocks human potential and opens a path to another era of enlightenment as individuals empowered by AI can accomplish far more than they ever could before.
People say the next one-person unicorn is coming.
Technology–in particular social media–has had an arguably net negative impact on society–causing mental illness, social isolation, and echo chambers–while eroding traditional community bonds. Without proper safeguards, AI has the potential to cause even greater damage to society.
Cases of sycophantic AI chatbots leading users to psychotic breakdowns.

#Business Leaders
Business leaders should consider that AI’s greatest value comes from augmenting workers, not replacing them.
Andrej Karpathy’s Ironman Robot versus Ironman Suit 
Business transformation does not come from simply investing in AI technology–but even more so from investing in people to learn and adapt to an AI-native environment.
Alin’s hot take: The term “AI-first” diminishes the focus on people and processes. Alin prefers “AI-native”.
The reason why most AI-projects fail is the same reason why most technology rollouts fail in companies–the people and processes have not been properly prioritized.
MIT’s viral report that 90% of AI projects fail
AI projects in particular will fail because AI in the form of language models requires tuning to business behaviors and sentiments–not simply to technical prerequisites.
Managers need to learn how to manage both humans as well as AI agents. This implies the impending rise of an “agentic workforce”.

#Workers
Workers should consider that their best strategy to not just safeguard–but accelerate–their careers is by mastering AI technologies. That means most every role must learn to be semi-technical.
Most people are employed in zombie jobs that will disappear as AI improves; and those who do not adapt to learning AI will lose careers.
Agentic AI allows every worker to become a manager of a digital agentic team.

#Technology
Agentic AI spans a range of autonomy–from simple AI automation to truly autonomous agents, with some degree of human supervision in the loop.
Andrej Karpathy’s Slider of Autonomy
Scaling laws may not continue increasing intelligence if the Internet becomes overrun with AI slop, or if there is insufficient electrical power for all this processing power, or if LLMs intrinsically cannot break out beyond the limitations of using language as a proxy to understand how the world works.
Yann LeCun’s position that true AI will need to model the physics of reality.
The theory of the dead Internet
The technology itself is not too complex to be understood conceptually. Business leaders just need a guide and interpreter to help them grasp the concepts and applications. Alin believes there is opportunity for a “Business Whisperer for AI”.
